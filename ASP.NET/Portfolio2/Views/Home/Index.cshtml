        <p>My favorite color is green. I'm going to begin work soon in web development. It's a total change. I often
            struggle with feeling not enough. I think it prevents me from success. Even as I look at this webpage I feel
            bad because I know it could be better. But I give myself credit for showing up and doing the assignment. In
            the case of depression, anything worth doing is worth doing poorly. I do hope to achieve better things and
            to look at myself as enough one day. </p>
